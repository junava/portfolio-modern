# ⍟ JOACHIM ULRICH NAVA – BRUTALIST PORTFOLIO

A personal portfolio website built in the **brutalist/manual** aesthetic – raw, grid‑based, monospaced, and highly interactive. Inspired by [The Creative Website Manual™](https://www.creativewebmanual.com), this site functions both as a showcase and a playground for experimental front‑end features.

🧠 INSPIRATION & CREDITS
Layout and typography heavily influenced by The Creative Website Manual™.

Magnetic cursor idea adapted from various brutalist portfolios.

Tetris game logic originally written by myself but inspired by jstris, TETR.io, and the official 2009 Tetris Design manual and restyled to match the portfolio aesthetic.
